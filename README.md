### Introduction

Sometime late last winter(2021), in an effort teach myself more about development
workflows, I decided to center my focus on working with Python web frameworks.
Previously, I had experience building a number of small, standalone projects and
scripts. By looking into using web frameworks, I was starting with a project that
already had a large number of 'moving parts' and a reasonably large infrastructure
to work with (e.g. package/dependency management, testing, documentation, deployment, etc.)

I originally started with a couple applications using Flask and realized that it
was a bit too 'open-ended' for my skill-level/interests. I soon found myself pivoting
to Django and its eco-system. Django is a pretty mature technology with a number
of third party packages, great documentation and came with a large number of 
'batteries included' at the outset of a new project. This not only gave me some
training wheels with which to start; it also set some reasonable boundaries for me
to focus my efforts.

Below are the links to my various efforts/projects in Flask, Django, Django REST
Framework, React, and FastAPI from the past year of work and learning. Most, if not all of the projects, are what I would consider minimally viable projects(MVPs) of some fairly routine/traditional apps(e.g. to-do lists, blogs, bookstore, etc.).
So, these aren't(currently) completely polished, finished projects; but rather I see them as more
of a template, for me, for building an end-to-end development workflow and overall learning process. Fin.
